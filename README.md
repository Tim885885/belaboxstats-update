Setup:
1. Edit `app.js` and put your remote cloud key in `var key = "***KEY HERE***"`
2. edit `var eth0 = "***You network name***"` or var `wlan0 = "***You network Name***"` etc.
3. Run `npm i `

Running the app:
1. In the same folder, run `node app.js`

A file `belaboxstats.txt` will be created in this folder. That will contain the output of the app.

If it connected okay to the remote, the file will contain like:
Network Status:
Chunghwa Telecom: 5 Kbps
Asia Pacific: 0 Kbps
Taiwan Mobile: 0 Kbps

if it could not connect to the remote or key wrong, the file will contain `Belabox: connection offline!`
