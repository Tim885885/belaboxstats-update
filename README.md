# Fetch Belabox stats from remote cloud and save to file.

Based on the modifications made to the previous personal version, I am making it capable of real-time updates and displaying the correct network names written into the file.

### Requirement
Node is required. can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Setup:
1. Edit `app.js` and put your remote cloud key in `var key = "***KEY HERE***"`
2. edit `var eth0 = "***You network name***"` or var `wlan0 = "***You network Name***"` etc. (The name of the network telecom you want)
3. Run `npm i `

### Running the app:
1. In the same folder, run `node app.js`
A file `belaboxstats.txt` will be created in this folder. That will contain the output of the app.

If it connected okay to the remote, the file will contain like:

 - `Network Status:`
 - `Chunghwa Telecom: 5 Kbps`
 - `Asia Pacific: 0 Kbps`
 - `Taiwan Mobile: 0 Kbps`
 - `Far EasTone: 0 Kbps`
 - `Total bitrate: 5 Kbps`
 - `Temperature: 37.0 Â°C`


### Setup on OBS

1. Create a text
2. Select from file
3. selected belaboxstats.txt

This way, you will have real-time network status information from Belabox on your OBS.

if it could not connect to the remote or key wrong, the file will contain `Belabox: connection offline!`
